This is an application of Neural Network for prediction on Kuzushiji-MNIST data set.
The model was base on the AlexNet, simplified to occupy the size of Kuzushiji-MNIST data set.

# Installation/Usage
Download the notebook Team_BackProp.ipynb and open it using Jupyter Notebook or upload to Google Colab.
The notebook contains instructions on how to navigate all the function presented.

## Data Installation
The data should be downloaded from: https://www.kaggle.com/c/acse-module-8-19/data
This should be placed in a folder within your google drive named "acse-module-8-19/"

such that the following path is valid, and all the data is within this directory:

/content/gdrive/My Drive/Colab Notebooks/Mini-Project/acse-module-8-19/


# Result
The final model obtained an accuracy of 97.914% on the private leaderboard, and 98.266% on the public leaderboard.

The model with the best accuracy is : Backprop_Model2.pt

It's prediction is : Backprop_Model2_prediction.csv

The second best model is : Backprop_Model1.pt

It's prediction is : Backprop_Model1_prediction.csv
